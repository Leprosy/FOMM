Fans of Might & Magic is an open source proyect which tries to implement a RPG engine based on the World of Xeen one, at least in the basics. I was implementing it in Java, because it's one of my favorites programming languages, and sort of an excercise in java graphics, now I'm porting everything to Python, because I'm learning to code in it and currently I'm liking it a lot.
