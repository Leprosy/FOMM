Fans of Might & Magic is an open source proyect which tries to implement a RPG  
engine based on the World of Xeen one, at least in the basics. I'm implementing 
it in Java, because it's one of my favorites programming languages, and sort of 
an excercise in java graphics.

Currently, I'm just beginning this proyect and it'll be taking some time to make
